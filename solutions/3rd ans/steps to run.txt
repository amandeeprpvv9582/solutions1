STEPS TO RUN THE SCRIPT

for this programme we need the linux command, so install ubuntu or any linux based terminal

1) open a text editor and put the source code into it and name it script.py

2) open ubuntu terminal 

3) in script.py we need a file name top_ouput.txt which will be generated by the top command in
the terminal so used this command
         top -b -n 1 > top_output.txt
this command basically run the top command and the output of top command are stored in the top_output.txt


4) now run the script.py in terminal using following command
     python3 script.py

now in console PIDS will start to appear.
